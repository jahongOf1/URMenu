# URMenu

Your Food, Your Menu

Developed during Build The Bay Hackathon 1.0 
42 Silicon Valley and Newark, CA

We were asked by local restaurant and government to create a e-guide to the local eateries
of the city. 

Our idea was to create a reuseable backend API that held the
up-to date information on the restaurants. 
Primarily the menu which would have information that would allow 
the items to be sorted via ingredients/special dietary restrictions.

It was the team's first time using ReactJS, and first time working on web programming period.
Due to limited time, I could only implement basic functions such
as map of Newark, map markers, and front-end search fitler using ReactJS.

## Getting Started

npm run dev 
```
localhost:3000 for front-end interface

## Deployment

In the current build, we do not recommend deploying it since it.
Due to the rushed nature of the hackathon we were forced to build 
CORS workaround function to make some things work. 

## Built With
