# URMenu

Your Food, Your Menu

Developed during Build The Bay Hackathon 1.0 
42 Silicon Valley and Newark, CA

We were asked by local restaurant and government to create a e-guide to the local eateries
of the city. 

Our idea was to create a reuseable backend API that held the
up-to date information on the restaurants. 
Primarily the menu which would have information that would allow 
the items to be sorted via ingredients/special dietary restrictions.

Due to limited time, we could only implement basic functions such
as map of Newark, map markers, and front-end search fitler.
